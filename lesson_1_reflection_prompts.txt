How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    It pointed the bug right out. Made it super easy to find out were I went
    wrong.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    It would allow me to make big changes and know that I can roll them back at
    any time. This would free me to take bigger risks and try new things.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    I think it is better that you get to choose when to save a change. That way
    you are able to save right before you make a big change and can easily roll
    back to a functioning version.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    you save multipul files because they are usually linked. You may have
    changed a variable name across multipul files.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    You use git log to see a log on your commits then you take the ID's of two
    of the commit and use git diff to see the difference between the two
    commits.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

  It would allow me to make big changes and know that I can roll them back at
  any time. This would free me to take bigger risks and try new things.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    I will try using git for all my future projects.

	   Use get log to see all the commit ID's. Use git log to see the
     difference between the commit ID's

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    I would like to try and make sure that all my projects are using git, and
    that they are connected to git hub.

What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

    You basically create a git repository.
    You need to do this do that you can create a git repository and track your changes.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

    You move from working to staging. You only put things into staging that you
    are going to commit. This allows you to push some things but not all things.

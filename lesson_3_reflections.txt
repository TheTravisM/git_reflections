When would you want to create a remote directory rather than keeping all your work 
local?

    You would want to create a local directory when you would like to share you 
    code with other people and colaboriate. You would also do this so that you 
    have a back up of your code.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    You would want to pull changes maually so that none of your code breaks.
    You would pull to stay upto day as your work flow would permit.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Fork: When you pull from a branch to make a new one as to not affect the orgional branch.
    
    Clone: When you copy an entire project.
    
    Branch: Different versions of the same project that coexit but do not affect each other.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    The allows you to stay of to date with the latest changes of the code base.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  
What would be easier, and what would be harder?

    SVN is another way to colaberate without using Git
    It depends on you personally. I like git more.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?

    You should never work directly in master. You should always create a seperate brach.
    This way you will always have a functional master branch.
